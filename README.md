## Observer pattern

The Observer Pattern, is used in scenarios when updates need to be done at Observers depending on changes in state on a Subject.

An example is that of a Stock broker application. When the Subject (Stock data) changes the Observer(Income handler) is updated with the changes.

The Decorator Pattern provides a way to use composition for enhancing functionality where the expected result has a direct dependency on the composed and composing class.

An example is that of a Pizza application. Pizzas are made with various bases and a combinations of toppings.
